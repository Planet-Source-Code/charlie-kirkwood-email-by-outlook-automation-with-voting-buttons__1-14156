## Email by Outlook Automation with Voting Buttons

### Description

This is based on Dylan Morley's Program msOutlook Library.

I took his program and added functionality for voting buttons, storage and retrieval of recipient list/voting options, clearing of form.

I changed the interface, added error trapping, hotkeys and hourglass functionality. I didn't change any of Dylan's original code-I just added code in necessary places and added error trapping. SO you may notice a change in the variable/scope naming convention in some places.

Thanks Dylan for the start - i needed this

to help us at work figure out what we're

doing for lunch every day. Each day

i send a list of options out to my

lunch cronies, we go with the place

with the highest vote.

(note: this program uses microsoft's outlook automation library msoutl85.olb

This program also requires the Microsoft Scripting Runtime (scrrun.dll) which can be obtained by installing any one of the following packages: Windows Script Host Windows NT Option Pack Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 Scripting 3.1 upgrade Visual Studio 98 Visual Basic 6.0 )

Use this however you want.
